        <h2>Our Traditional weddings</h2>
        <p class="wedding">Traditional Indian weddings are unique, for the parents and families of the couples are much more involved in them then the actual bride and groom. If observed closely, one would definitely realize that a wedding in India is an event where not only two individuals come together for life, but also their families. <br>
            There’s a noticeable rise in the expenditure on wedding planning from previous weddings of the last generation. Every couple wants to stand out from the rest, and outdo the last. It’s become more of a compulsion than a tradition, to go all guns blazing and burn half of the family’s savings for this one occasion. Nowhere in the world you’ll find people expending as much on marriage celebrations as in India, and hence, the weddings here are rightly tagged as ‘The Big Fat Indian Weddings’.

          <p class="wedding">Traditionally, the young bride and the groom were rarely granted a choice on matters regarding their own wedding. However, this is the 21st Century and couple want to decide collaboratively on every matter, right from the engagement rings, wedding invitations, and selection of wedding venue, to catering, and even the music selection and photography services. <br>

            The millennial bride and groom plan their wedding day quite differently than traditional weddings taking place for generations. They may choose to splurge on entertainment services rather than the wedding process. A luxury getaway into the hills might be their ideal wedding venue, rather than stereotypical large palaces and banquet halls. <br>
            
            The young generation, being more educated than ever, is conscious about their social responsibilities, and chooses to help out what they believe in instead of receiving age old materialistic gifts. Taking this into account, wedding registries also allow the guests to donate the money for any charities or causes in which the wedding couple or the guests themselves support.</p>
